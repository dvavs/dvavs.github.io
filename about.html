            <p>
                In a former life, I was on the path to become a professor of neuroscience and/or psychology. After 9
                years pursuing that goal my priorities have changed, and in May, 2019 I threw myself headlong into the
                exciting world of development by joining the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the University of
                Richmond (run by Trilogy Ed).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As you might expect of someone who was once interested in becoming a professor, I have an insatiable
                passion for learning. Since finishing the web development bootcamp, I've pointed that passion toward
                acquiring new skills in development (currently I'm working on Java and AWS). I aspire to continue
                pushing the breadth and depth of my skillset to become the best developer I can be. Particularly I am
                interested in expanding my knowledge as it relates to machine learning.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                When I am not playing with code, you can find me hiking the Blue Ridge, reading academic papers (and
                sometimes writing my own!) or relaxing at home with my wife, two cats, and a good craft beer.
