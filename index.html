      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student in the University of Richmond Full Stack Web Development coding bootcamp. I currently work as a research assistant at the same university. I had been planning to attend graduate school in either psychology or neuroscience to obtain a PhD, but I've decided to take another path. I chose to join this bootcamp to hopefully jumpstart a new career.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Orlando, Florida, but moved to Virginia at the age of 7. I don't remember much before that time, so I consider Matoaca, VA to be my hometown.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love hiking, rock climbing, and indulging in creative activities - from drawing, to painting, to pottery. I love to <i>play</i> sports, and my favorites are volleyball and ultimate. I'm also a big fan of leisurely activities, like playing video games or relaxing on the porch with a beer and a good friend.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't really have a dream job; I can see myself being quite happy in a number of career industries and settings. Rather, my chief motivating force is to be useful in whatever I do. Further, I want to master whatever discipline I find myself in to the degree that I can help others learn it too.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Henrico, just outside of Richmond, VA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because the profession strikes me as one that would allow for a perfect marriage of my drive to master practical skills and my desire to exercise creativity.</p>
