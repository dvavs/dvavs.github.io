                            <p>My name is Dylan Vavra. In 2014, I graduated from the University of Richmond
                                with
                                a
                                Bachelor's in
                                Psychology, and since then I have been working as a research assistant (in
                                the
                                very
                                same
                                department!). For as long as I can remember, my goal has been to attend
                                graduate
                                school,
                                earn a
                                Ph.D, and go on to be a professor. However, over the past few years I have
                                gotten
                                more
                                of a
                                holistic view of academia - the culture, the job market, the economic
                                realities
                                -
                                and
                                have
                                concluded that the other goals I have for myself and my family are worth
                                more to
                                me.
                                I've
                                decided to venture on a new career path, so I've joined UR's Full Stack Web

                            <p>My background has helped me develop some skills that I think will come in
                                handy
                                as I
                                transition
                                into a different line of work. I am skilled in scientific writing, have
                                exposure
                                to
                                a
                                wide
                                breadth of platforms (from Qualtrics, to Eyelink eyetracking systems, to
                                Noldus
                                behavioral
                                observation software, to ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online), and I am no stranger
                                to
                                hard
                                work. I
                                have spent considerable time debugging experiment applications and
                                copyediting
                                manuscripts
                                for
                                publication, and I pride myself on being very keenly attentive to detail.
                                Relatedly,
                                management
                                of massive datasets and stimulus databases has helped me develop an accumen

                                organization. Finally, I have a thorough understanding of research design
                                and
                                data

                                couch

                                cats Herbie and Tiptoe. Occasionally I like to have a beer - even more so if
                                I
                                can

                                nature. My profile picture shows me doing just that, on a beach outside
